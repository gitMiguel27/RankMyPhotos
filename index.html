        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>
            The following pictures were taken during my college years. I took a film photography class and loved it. In this class, I went through the whole process of learning how to use a film camera, develop my film, and print my own pictures. Here are some of my favorite pictures from that class. I hope to continue to pursue this passion of mine in the future. Big shoutout to my friends and family seen in some of the pictures.
