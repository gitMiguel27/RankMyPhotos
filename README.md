WELCOME TO RANK MY PHOTOS!

About:
This project is based around my passion for photography. I took a photography class in college and enjoyed learning about the process of developing and printing my own film. In this project, you can find some of the photos I took and printed myself. During class, we would present our prints and listen to feedback and comments from the rest of class. That is my inspiration for this project - to mimick that engagement but in an online platform.

Tech Stack
For this project, I am using Bootstrap in conjunction with HTML5 and CSS3.
